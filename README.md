# Recommendation-System
Here is a simple recommendation system built that was built using the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN) and using the beauty dataset from amazon which can be found here
http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Beauty_5.json.gz

There are mainly 2 types of Recommendation Syetems , this project I have used Item-based Collaborative Filtering because this recommendation system will identify the products based on users' previous ratings on a similar product

This dataset contains a summary column which will help me in finding if the review is positive or negative and later help in finding similar products.
I have used 3 KNN algorithmns which are Ball Tree , KD Tree and Brute Force with differernt values of 'k'. 
Lastly I've also created a wordcloud that will cluster all the similar words together.
